# Connected Bus Monitor - Concept

Connected Bus Monitor is a service aimed at providing Near Real-Time updates on indoor air quality conditions of ground public transport.


# Goals

The goals of the proposed service are to improve public transport by striving to enforce

1. Sustainability
2. Safety
3. Salubrity


The project connects to Open Impact in the area of Urban Regeneration through sustainable mobility.
It aims to provide incentives to use public transport and consider it a reliable and affordable means of sustainable mobility
it is oriented at reducing emissions, congestion and occupation of parking spaces in urban areas.
The proposed solution does not impose constraints on the transport units' engine type,
 thereby guaranteeing feasibility and viability in short terms in the perspective of a transition towards
 the wide use of zero emission vehicles.

 The European Union Council of Ministers of Transport defines sustainable mobility as a service that

1. allows the basic access and development needs of individuals, companies and societies to be met safely and in a manner consistent
  with human and ecosystem health, and promotes equity within and between successive generations;

1. is affordable, operates fairly and efficiently, offers choice of transport mode, and supports a competitive economy, as well as balanced regional development;


# Requirements Specification

## Functional Requirements

- The service must insure public transport air quality monitoring (temperature, humidity, CO2)
- The service shall provide the Air Quality values in a Near Real-Time offset (under one minute sampling period)
- The service shall enforce network security policies


# User Personas

The user needs taken into account include having insight on the current air quality metrics on ground transport means (buses, trams)


In order to provide quality of service information, Connected Bus Monitor takes into account the needs of two main user personas
1. Public transport users
2. Public transport drivers   

## 1. Public transport user's point of view (Problem description)

a) Private sector employee

b) Student


## 2. Public transport driver's point of view

a) Public bus driver
