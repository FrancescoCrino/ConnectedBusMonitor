# Connected Bus Monitor - Concept
IoT 2022 First Delivery

Connected Bus Monitor is a service aimed at providing (near) real time estimates of waiting times/proximity
and indoor air quality conditions of surface public transport.


# Goals

The goals of the proposed service are to improve public transport by striving to guarantee
 
1. Sustainability
2. Reliability
3. Affordability
4. Salubrity and Safety


The project connects to Open Impact in the area of Urban Regeneration through sustainable mobility.
It aims to provide incentives to use public transport and consider it a reliable and affordable means of sustainable mobility
it is oriented at reducing emissions, congestion and occupation of parking spaces in urban areas.
The proposed solution does not impose constraints on the transport units' engine type,
 thereby guaranteeing feasibility and viability in short terms in the perspective of a transition towards
 the wide use of zero emission vehicles. 
 
 The European Union Council of Ministers of Transport defines sustainable mobility as a service that
 
1. allows the basic access and development needs of individuals, companies and societies to be met safely and in a manner consistent
  with human and ecosystem health, and promotes equity within and between successive generations;

1. is affordable, operates fairly and efficiently, offers choice of transport mode, and supports a competitive economy, as well as balanced regional development;
 

 
The user needs are access to affordable and reliable shared public transport options and broadly speaking, having the opportunity of making informed choices on mobility solutions.


In order to provide quality of service information, Connected Bus Monitor takes into account the needs of two main user personas
1. Public  transport users
2. Public transport drivers   

## 1. Public transport user's point of view (Problem description)

a) Private sector employee

Goals/Needs  
       
Punctuality
Safeguard personal health

Pain Points/Frustrations

Fears the risk implied in making uninformed choices
Eagerness/Low waiting time tolerance


b) Student

Goals/Needs

- Access to affordable transport options
- Availability of public transport options for most mobility needs (private options unavailable)
- Safeguarding personal and environmental health

Pain Points/Frustrations

- Increased numerosity of private transport means in his city (traffic/congestion, pollution)


## 2. Public transport driver's point of view
a) Public bus driver

Goals/Needs
- Safety in the work environment
- Safeguarding personal health
- Professionality

Pain Points/Frustrations
- Passenger complaints
