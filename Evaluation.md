# Evaluation
Evaluating ConnectedBusMonitor can be done in different way. Different approaches can be measured inorder to evaluate the proposed device such as:

### Hardware:
- Cost
- Precision
- Latency
- Reactiveness
- Low Power Consumption

### Network Technologies:
- Long Range connection
- Network Reliability:
- Low number of loss packets
- Scalability
- Low Power consumption
- LoRa constraints

### End-user 
- User experience 

Along doing this project, up to the second delivery different metrics will be used to measure and evaluate this device
