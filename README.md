# Connected Bus Monitoring
**Connected Bus Monitor** is a service aimed at providing (near) real time estimates of waiting times/proximity and indoor air quality monitoring of surface public transport. 

## ‚ú® Main Idea
Have you ever used public transportation and felt unsatistied along your short trip? This project proposes a solution to overcome this situation. The project connects to Open Impact in the area of Urban regeneration through sustainable mobility. It aims to provide incentives for the use of public transport as a reliable and affordable means of sustainable mobility.

With the proposed device, we want to provide for the commuters an application withwhich they can check the Temperature and CO2 and the location of vehicle and choose the best way to reach the destination based on their needs. 

So, the main goal of the project is to improve the user experience by:
- Reducing the waste of time 
- Improving the travel conditions
- Fournishing correct correct informations through near real-time data
- Guaranty safety (Health point of view)
