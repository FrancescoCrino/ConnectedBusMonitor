# Connected Bus Monitoring 
**Connected Bus Monitor** is a service aimed at providing (near) real time estimates of waiting times/proximity and indoor air quality monitoring of the public transport.  

## ‚ú® Main Idea
Bus transport is a relatively cheap and flexible kind of transport, because it gives possibility to transport the passengers from one door to another door. Therefore, this kind of people‚Äôs travelling develops continuously. Hence, the indoor air quality (IAQ) should satisfy the proper standards: [ASHRAE](https://www.ashrae.org/File%20Library/Technical%20Resources/Standards%20and%20Guidelines/Standards%20Intepretations/62-89-01.pdf), [European standard](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwjB85XN4af3AhUJSvEDHeMEB64QFnoECAUQAQ&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cres.gr%2Fgreenbuilding%2FPDF%2Fprend%2Fset4%2FWI_25_Pre-FV_version_prEN_13779_Ventilation_for_non-resitential_buildings.pdf&usg=AOvVaw2bSD2wJt-MJwniiQjHBOB5) or [WHO](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwiuzf3o4af3AhVLR_EDHcl8DjYQFnoECAMQAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fapps.who.int%2Firis%2Fhandle%2F10665%2F107335&usg=AOvVaw3krYfTL5Z95Sk8yHv1gu5B). However, indoor air quality (IAQ) in the buses has not been investigated in depth so far. The most important parameter is Carbon Dioxide (CO2) concentration which is not controlled by a proper system. In-door Carbon Dioxide is an air component and it is not thought a poisonous gas. However, if CO2 concentration rises up to 5% in air breathing its causes higher partial blood pressure, anxiety or makes breathing more difficult and more frequent.

Aside what in-door could do it self, people are now more concerned about in-door air quality of public transport becuase of the COVID.
Based on the experiments which are done (attached at the bottom) it is said that on busy trams and buses, the permitted CO2 concentration of 900 ppm ("parts per million") is regularly exceeded. This is apparent from a sample of [VRT NWS](https://www.vrt.be/vrtnws/nl/2021/12/21/co2-metingen-openbaar-vervoer). If there is an infected passenger in the vicinity, a high CO2 level is a signal of a high chance of transmitting the virus. ‚ÄúWe rely on the common sense of the people. If your bus is full, consider waiting a few minutes for the next one,‚Äù De Lijn responds. Carbon dioxide is air component and it is not thought the gas is poisonous. However, if CO2 concentration rises up to 5% in air breathing its causes higher partial blood pressure, anxiety or makes breathing more difficult and more frequent.

This project proposes a solution to slightly overcome this situation. The project connects to Open Impact in the area of Urban regeneration through sustainable mobility. It aims to provide incentives for the use of public transport as a reliable and affordable means of sustainable mobility.

With the proposed device, we would like to provide the commuters an application with which they can check the Temperature and CO2 and the location of vehicle and choose the best way to reach the destination based on their options. 

So, the main goal of the project is to improve the user experience by:
- Reducing the waste of time 
- Improving the travel conditions
- Fournishing correct correct informations through near real-time data
- Guaranty safety (Health point of view)

During this project, experiments were done on local buses, trams, trains and metros during a normal working day in different hours of a day in Rome. The device used to gather data is a simple CO2 meter which can be found simply on online markets. The focus of attention was carbon dioxide concentration. The permitted value 900-1000 ppm of CO2 was exceeded many times during the experiment and the maximum measured concentration was 2500 ppm. 

This experiment has been done in other cities as well:
