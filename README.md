# Connected Bus Monitoring  

## ‚ú® Main Idea

One of the big challenges for the cities of the future is to dicrease the number of  vehicles in the city to reduce the air pollution. One strategy to reduce the number of vehicles is to provide an efficient public transportation. To convince the people to use public trasportation instead of a personal vehicle the public transportation service has to be efficient in terms of reliability, deployment and it also need to be confortable. In fact many people consider taking a public trasport a stressfull experience. We have tried to understand why nowadays taking a bus is still considered a stressfull experience. Of course one cause could be the punctuality of the service but also the travelling conditions have a big impact on the experience. </br>
Many studies have shown that the surrounding environment has a big impact on our mood, in particular high level of CO2 can leads to drowsiness, lethargy, fatigue, headaches, breathing problems. In general we have high concentration of CO2 in closed spaces or in space with lots of people, if we think to a bus, it is a small space, often crowded and that does not guarantee a good sir ventilation at any time. </br>
Our *Connected Bus Monitor* device aims to monitor the bus cabin in terms of temperature, humidity and CO2. The data collected can be accesed through a web page and can be used by the users to have a look on the state of the bus, but they can also be usefull from a maintainance point of view. </br>
Our device can be used by the public transport operators to monitor their vehicles and offer at any time the best travelling conditions and also it can be used by the users to choose the means of transport to be taken more consciously, making the experience less stressful possible.</br>
