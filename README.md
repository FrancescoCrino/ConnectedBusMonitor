# Connected Bus Monitoring
**Connected Bus Monitor** is a service aimed at providing (near) real time estimates of waiting times/proximity and indoor air quality monitoring of surface public transport. 

## ✨ Main Idea
On busy trams and buses, the permitted CO2 concentration of 900 ppm ("parts per million") is regularly exceeded. This is apparent from a sample of VRT NWS. If there is an infected passenger in the vicinity, a high CO2 level is a signal of a high chance of transmitting the virus. “We rely on the common sense of the people. If your bus is full, consider waiting a few minutes for the next one,” De Lijn responds.  
This project proposes a solution to overcome this situation. The project connects to Open Impact in the area of Urban regeneration through sustainable mobility. It aims to provide incentives for the use of public transport as a reliable and affordable means of sustainable mobility.

With the proposed device, we want to provide for the commuters an application withwhich they can check the Temperature and CO2 and the location of vehicle and choose the best way to reach the destination based on their needs. 

So, the main goal of the project is to improve the user experience by:
- Reducing the waste of time 
- Improving the travel conditions
- Fournishing correct correct informations through near real-time data
- Guaranty safety (Health point of view)
